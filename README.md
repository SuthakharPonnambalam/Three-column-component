## Overview

The notion of this challenge was to recreate a stats preview component that was provided. The necessary images and style components were provided and the intention was to recreate the design as close as possible to meet the requirements.

## My Process

1. I started getting the HTML component first and then proceeded to the CSS part. 
2. I started by making it a mobile first page and used media queries to make it responsive to desktop version.
3. If you skim through my code, you could see that:
    * I had used a wrapper container and I placed all the three cards inside it. The outer and inner containers are flex enabled. 
    * Each individual card has several properties that are common and hence I've grouped several styles together and made some as standalone styles. 
    * The buttons change their properties when hovered upon.
4. Finally all the four edges were made rounded using seperate border radius property and the body was given a background color. 
5. The font used is referenced to given style requirement. 

## Built With 

The webpage was created using HTML and CSS and is hosted on Github pages. 
1. HTML5
2. CSS 3
3. Flexbox
4. Media queries

## What I learned?

The learning was great. I learnt a lot about flexbox properties and media queries. And I also gave a try to the mobile first approach. I would appreciate all the feedback to improve the existing codebase especially tips around responsive web design. 

## Continued developement 

I have one major area where I could use a bit of help. The page is responsive currently. I have designed the page such that can resize depending on several breakpoints but the transition is not smooth and I would appreciate feedback regarding this.
